<h1>♛ 57BLOCKS Back-end TEST ♛ </h1>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

<p>
Design a library that converts the values of the properties of an arbitrary
object to another language/unit. The conversion rules are configurable.
</p>

<br>

<h2>Mandatory Features</h2>
<ul>

<li>The object is arbitrary. If a new object is added, no need to update the code to
support it.
</li>

<li>
The maximum nest level of objects hierarchy is 10.
</li>

<li> The object has properties of type string, integer, float, etc.
For strings please use a mock translation service.
</li>

<li>
A configuration is provided so that the library knows which property to convert
and how.
</li>

<li>
Please optimize and benchmark memory/cpu usage of your implementation,
and send the result together with the code.
</li>

</ul>
